Membership Retention Analysis and Prediction

# Membership Retention Analysis and Prediction

This repository contains the source code and documentation for my capstone project on membership retention analysis and prediction. The project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to identify factors affecting membership retention and predict churn, providing actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies.

## Overview
Membership retention is a key performance metric for subscription-based businesses. This project explores historical membership data to:
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns.
- Build and evaluate predictive models for identifying potential churners.
- Develop actionable strategies to enhance retention rates.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive analysis to uncover trends and relationships in the data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Machine learning models to forecast membership churn.
- **Visualization:** Intuitive charts and graphs for presenting insights.
- **Actionable Insights:** Recommendations to improve retention strategies.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your machine. Clone the repository and install the required libraries.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your_username/membership-retention.git
cd membership-retention

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project
1. **Data Preparation:** Place your dataset in the `data` folder and update the file paths in the scripts/notebooks.
2. **Run EDA:** Open and execute `01_eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to explore the data.
3. **Build Models:** Use `02_model_building.ipynb` to train and evaluate machine learning models.
4. **Generate Insights:** Review the `results/churn_analysis.pdf` for key findings and recommendations.

## Results
- Insights into key factors influencing membership retention.
- Predictive models with high accuracy in identifying potential churners.
- Visualizations that help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Future Work
- Integrate additional datasets for improved model accuracy.
- Deploy models in a web application for real-time churn prediction.
- Incorporate advanced algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
